# Reverse Proxy

This Node.js application functions as a reverse proxy, enabling you to serve any ASGI application on a cPanel server. By utilizing the Node.js application feature in cPanel, you can route requests to a specific port where your application is running.

In this project, the proxy routes requests to Andy's server, which is running on port 8080 on the cPanel server.
